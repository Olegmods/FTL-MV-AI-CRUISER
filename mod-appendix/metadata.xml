<![CDATA[ THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES! Make sure to patch Inferno Core and Vertex Tags and Utility Functions first!

This mod adds a new race of AI hardlight Avatars from a distant universe which will eventually be developed upon further, both with type B and C layouts as well as eventually events and lore inspired by the AI Avatar race from Captains Edition and Hyperspace by Sleeper Service.

This sample includes:
- AI Cruiser type A
- 3 New Weapons
  - Effector mk I, a projector that hacks into enemy systems
  - Auto Beam, a beam that after firing drops to a quick 2.5 second cooldown
  - Splitter Focus Beam II, a 'flak beam' that fires 4 focus beams
- New Race: AI Avatar's, a synthetic race of disposable hardlight avatars with many immunities
- New Augment: Hologram Emitter, an augment that lets you produce an AI hologram when one perishes
