<![CDATA[ THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES! Make sure to patch Vertex Tags and Utility Functions first! (links bellow)

This mod adds a new race of AI hardlight Avatars from a distant universe which will eventually be developed upon further, both with type B and C layouts as well as eventually events and lore inspired by the AI Avatar race from Captains Edition and Hyperspace by Sleeper Service.

This sample includes:
- AI Cruiser type A
- 5 New Weapons
  - Effector mk I, a projector that hacks into enemy systems
  - Auto Beam, a beam that after firing drops to a quick 2.5 second cooldown
  - Splitter Focus Beam II, a 'flak beam' that fires 4 focus beams
  - EMP Device, a weapon that fires a projectile that knocks down 2 layers of shields, while dealing 2 ion damage on system room hit.
  - Ion Bust Beam, which can deal double damage on ionized rooms but in doing so clears the ion effect.
- 2 New Drones
  - Interceptor Microfighter, a drone that is technically more sentient than you. An evasive drone that focuses fire on enemy defence drones before targeting the ship.
  - Shock Microfighter, piloted by an obnoxious avatar, this drone targets enemy systems with its light EMP device repeatedly while evading enemy fire.
- New Race: AI Avatar's, a synthetic race of disposable hardlight avatars with many immunities
- New Augments
  - Hologram Emitter, an augment that lets you produce an AI hologram when one perishes at empty beacons
  - Sentient Combat computer, improves most systems by 5%
  - Rerouted Insulation, gives the ship a 80% ion resistance while all crew onboard are more susceptable to stuns.
