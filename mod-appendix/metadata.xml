<![CDATA[ This mod adds a new race of AI hardlight Avatars from a distant universe which will eventually be developed upon further, both with type B and C layouts as well as eventually events and lore.

This sample includes:
	• AI Cruiser type A
    • 3 New Weapons
		◦ Effector mk I, a projector that hacks into enemy systems.
		◦ Auto Beam, a beam that after firing drops to a quick 2.5 second cooldown
		◦ Splitter Focus Beam II, a 'flak beam' that fires 4 focus beams.
	• New Race: AI Avatar's, a synthetic race of disposable hardlight avatars with many immunities
	• New Augment: Hologram Emmiter, an augment that lets you produce an AI hologram when one perishes.
	
Load after Multiverse.
