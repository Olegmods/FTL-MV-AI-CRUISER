<text name="rvs_tip_effector">Tip: Effectors pierce all shields and hack systems. They cannot hack systems which already have a hacking drone. Hacked systems temporarily become immune to effector hacking once the hack has completed.</text>
<text name="rvs_tip_focus_split">Tip: Splitter pinpoint beams trade the high damage of most pinpoints for multiple beams, allowing for higher potential damage if the target's shields are down.</text>

<text name="rvs_tip_emp">Tip: EMP projectiles pop 2 layers of shields on impact and deals ion damage on direct system hits.</text>
<text name="rvs_tip_emp_heavy">Tip: Heavy EMP projectiles pop 4 layers of shields on impact, otherwise it deals heavy ion damage on system hits and some ion damage to adjacent systems.</text>
