    <text>The lights of the strange vessel flicker before falling dark as their hull cracks open violently in one final explosion.</text>
	<text>Exploding in a bright light the mysterious vessel is now no more beyond a scattering of debris and scrap at this beacon.</text>
	<text>One final barrage marks their end. Their hull warping and crackling as its reactor detonates.</text>
    <text>You wonder where these ships come from. The tech you collect from the ships remains are advanced and alien to you. Which you hope would be worth a fancy premium.</text>
    <text>You wonder if the ship itself is sentient or is it the host for these intelligent constructs. You doubt it is truly that intelligent, seeing as its pieces are scattered throughout this system now.</text>
    <text>If you weren't able to tell which side was the front or back of this ship you most certainly can't now, as its structure is shattered under your final blow. Scattering valuable scrap about.</text>
    <text>There are not sure what happens to these constructs that once crewed this ship. Their hardlight forms dematerialise but beyond that it is a mystery. Do they die or did they ever truly live?</text>

	<text>The rogue vessel appears to be trying to escape! Though their digital minds are constantly backed up for mental evac, they are still partial to not dying.</text>
	<text>You detect high energy signatures in the rogue's engines. It must be trying to escape!</text>
	<text>The space darkens around the enemy vessel's engines as they prepare to perform an FTL jump. They're trying to escape!</text>

	<text>The rogues jumps away, along with garbled noise that is most likely laughter playing over your intercom. What jerks.</text>
	<text>A final volley would have signed their destruction if they hadn't jumped away.</text>
    <text>You have no idea what these ships are packing but it is clear their engine and FTL drive technology is unexpectedly advanced as there was nothing you could've done to stop their escape.</text>
    <text>Statistical analysis: 98.75% chance of evac success. Structural integrity: Sufficient. Analysing combat recording: Analysis 15%... 27%... 62%... 95%... 100%.
